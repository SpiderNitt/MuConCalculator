===========

About
-----

This is the version of the simple calculator application built during µCon 2015 Appdev (Day 2). Please follow the instructions given in order to get it running on your system.

Instructions
------------

- Click on `Check out project from Version Control` and select Github as shown:

- Follow the instructions. If Studio asks for your Github username and password, provide it
- When Studio prompts for your Repository URL, provide `https://github.com/SpiderNitt/MuConCalculator.git`. Click on _Test_ to ensure that it is working.
- Android Studio should successfully import the project onto your system. In case the build fails, it would generally be because your SDK and my SDK have different versions. In that case, Studio will provide you a clickable prompt underlined in red. On clicking this, you should be able to fix the build error. Follow Studio's instructions till you are able to build and run successfully.
- If you run into some abnormal errors, remember that Google is your friend, and StackOverflow is the wise old dude who generally has all the answers. Of course, you can also directly ping me (@mindstormer619 on Github, Facebook and Telegram) with the error, along with a screenshot, and I'll try and fix it for ya.

Have fun and happy coding! You may submit any improvements as pull requests if you like :)
